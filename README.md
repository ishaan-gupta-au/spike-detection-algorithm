# Spike Detection Algorithm 

Developed VBA algorithm to pinpoint action potentials in electrophysiological recording. The spike detection algorithm relies on three main inputs: 

1. Time series data
2. Lag window (number of data points for the rolling average and standard deviation)
3. Threshold (number of standard deviations each observation is away from the moving average)

Feel free to alter the lag and threshold values in the macro-enabled worksheet to pinpoint significant actional potentials in the recording.
